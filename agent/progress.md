## 2026-10-23 | FEAT-002 | status: done
Changed: packages/db (schema.ts for 13 product tables w/ cross-driver `$defaultFn(crypto.randomUUID)` text ids and `now()` default; migrations/0000_init.sql with ON DELETE CASCADE from projects to files/symbols/features/decisions/agent_sessions/requests/receipts and unique index files(project_id, path); migrations.ts driver-agnostic runner tracking `_brain_migrations`; migrate.mjs rewritten to apply SQL migrations via postgres.js in transactions; testing.ts createTestDb now applies migrations into PGlite; db.ts drizzle wrappers fromPglite/fromPostgres; repos/{projects,files,symbols,features,requests,receipts}.ts each requiring projectId as first arg; index.ts exports; added drizzle-orm + drizzle-kit (both already in docs/dependencies.md).
Verified (ran this session): `pnpm --filter @brain/db test -- --reporter=verbose` PASS 8/8 (AC-002-01..05 named in output); `pnpm -r --if-present typecheck` PASS all 5 packages; `bash scripts/verify.sh` PASS (typecheck, lint, tests, kit guard); `pnpm --filter @brain/db migrate` PASS (prints "DATABASE_URL not set; skipping migrations").
NOT VERIFIED: real Neon connection (no DATABASE_URL set in this session; migrate against real postgres happens when human runs it with a dev-branch URL).
Open questions: none.
Next step: FEAT-003 (better-auth with GitHub provider; users/sessions tables will be added then).

## 2026-10-23 | FEAT-001 | status: done

Verified (ran this session): pnpm install + pnpm -r build PASS; pnpm test -- --reporter=verbose PASS (7 tests; AC-001-01/02/03 named in output); bash scripts/verify.sh PASS; audit no high vulns (added postcss@>=8.5.18 override); next start on :3010 served HTTP 200 placeholder home and /api/health returned 503 {"ok":false,"db":false} in 1.7s with DATABASE_URL unset.
NOT VERIFIED: GitHub Actions workflow (local CI simulation PASS; actual run happens on push).
